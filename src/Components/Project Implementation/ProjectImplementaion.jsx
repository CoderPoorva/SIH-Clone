        The Smart India Hackathon (SIH) is envisioned to promote innovation and
        out-of-the-box thinking among young minds and aims to institutionalize a
        model for harnessing the creativity and technical expertise of millions
        of Indian students for the direct benefit of our nation. Through the
        Smart India Hackathon 2024 (SIH2024), the Ministry of Educationâ€™s
        Innovation Cell (MIC) tried to crowdsource solutions for improving
        governance and quality of life and provide young citizens with an
        opportunity to co-create and present innovative solutions to India's
        pressing needs.

        Post SIH, the Ministry of Education is committed to the further
        development, implementation, and deployment of SIH-winning ideas by
        effectively supporting the concerned ministries/departments. Hence, to
        initiate the development and deployment of SIH-winning ideas, the
        concerned Ministry/ Departments (Problem Statement given agency) is
        requested to follow the guidelines indicated below.

        The Intellectual Property (IP) of the solution resides with the students
        who have developed and deployed the solution post-Hackathon but the
        concerned ministry will have lifetime access to the solution for free.
        This has been done to encourage Startups to be created out of the
        developed solutions while also keeping in mind the interest of the
        involved ministries.
